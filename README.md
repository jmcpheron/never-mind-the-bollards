##  _(...a  little less "Anarchy in the parking lot"..._)

## ABOUT THE PROJECT

**NEVER MIND THE BOLLARDS** is a 3D printable bollard cap designed to cover those ugly metal pipes sticking out of parking lots. Because even parking infrastructure deserves a proper punk makeover.

Born out of necessity and a love for DIY culture, this project aims to turn boring parking bollards into something worth looking at. No more dented, rusty eyesores - just pure, unadulterated BOLLARD STYLE.

## THE DIY ETHOS

The spirit of '77 lives on in this project. We believe in:

- **DO IT YOURSELF** - Print it. Modify it. Make it your own.
- **DO IT TOGETHER** - Share your remixes, improvements, and wild variations.
- **QUESTION AUTHORITY** - Who says parking lot infrastructure has to be boring?

This isn't just a bollard cap, it's a statement. A tiny rebellion against the mundane. A small act of creative defiance in the concrete jungle.

## FEATURES

- Designed in OpenSCAD for maximum hackability
- Fits standard parking bollard pipes (measurements in the specs)
- Weather-resistant when printed in appropriate materials
- Looks way cooler than a naked pipe
- Easy to customize for your own anarchic vision

## NO PARKING IN THE DANCE AREA

This project is open for collaboration. Fork it. Remix it. Print it. Share it.

We welcome:
- Design improvements
- Material experiments
- Wild customizations
- Installation photos from the wild

## GOD SAVE YOUR PARKING SPOT

Standard sizes are available, but the OpenSCAD file makes customization easy. Measure your bollard, adjust a few parameters, and you're ready to print your own perfect fit.
